# Flywheel üöó
![Screenshot 2022-02-26 193213](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66704595/155865869-dd136f6e-873d-4be3-aafa-d0c01ff16d11.png)

## About ‚úçÔ∏è

To build flywheel, we utilized a React front end which communicates to our Node.js/Express backend API via HTTP Requests. Our server/API directly communicates with the database via Mongoose queries, and we chose MongoDB as our (NoSQL) cloud database.

## Live Demo ‚òÅÔ∏è

Flywheel was deployed on Heroku, and can be accessed [here.](https://flywheelapp.herokuapp.com/)

## API Documentation üöÄ

The backend API was documented and tested using the Postman app. The documentation which was generated can be found [here.](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18239776/UVRAH74a)

### To Run üñ•Ô∏è

After you have cloned this git repository, please ensure you have npm and node.js installed. Next, please type

```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ..
npm install
```
to install all necessary node modules as specified in the client and server's package.json and then type

```bash
npm run dev
```

to run both the backend API/server (on localhost:5000) and the frontend client (on localhost:3000).
